## ðŸ’» My Work Experience

During my career so far, I've had the chance to work on a number of exciting projects, especially with **Micro-App architectures**. Some highlights include:

- Building an **App Store** for managing Micro-Apps, including installation, initialization and dependency management.
- Developing a **Micro-App** to visualize vehicle data from various APIs (e.g., Skoda and VW).
- Creating a **Micro-App** for user management with **Ory Kratos** integration.
- A **Micro-App** for managing user roles and permissions. It includes developer-friendly features such as hooks for easy usage in the UI, TRPC plugins with procedures for seamless permission retrieval, and caching mechanisms for performance optimization in the backend.
- A **Micro-App** for managing user and tenant configurations on our platform. It provides a system for Micro-Apps to define their own settings through metadata. The app delivers different configurations based on context, installed Micro-Apps, and permissions.
- And many more!

Unfortunately, these are all internal projects, so I can't share the code here on GitHub. However, working on them has given me valuable experience and helped me grow as a developer

## ðŸš€ What I'm Working On

Iâ€™m always working on something new, whether it's improving my knowledge of the latest web technologies, building open-source projects, or contributing to the community. I'm passionate about TypeScript, and I love learning about new tools and frameworks.

## ðŸŽ® A Little Backstory

I've always had a passion for technology and computer scienceâ€”it was my favorite subject in school. I would often spend entire nights writing small programs (which, looking back, were pretty rough! ðŸ˜„), but it sparked my love for coding early on. For fun, I also tried my hand at **game development**, experimenting with simple games.

After finishing school, I shifted my focus fully to **web development** and have been diving deep into it ever since.

## ðŸŒ± Always Learning

I'm still early in my journey as a developer, and I'm excited about the endless opportunities to learn and grow. I enjoy picking up new skills and technologies quickly, and I genuinely enjoy learning from more experienced developers. I'm always looking for new challenges and projects to work on!
